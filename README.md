# Beautiful-Bold-Brave-Creations

Description
This was the creation of my portfolio webpage, in which it is responsive to different screen sizes and highlights the work I have completed so far. This project was created using CSS and HTML. The bottons take you to other pages tied to my personal information. This is an overarching page that will be updated as more work is completed within the UC Berkeley cooding bootcamp.
